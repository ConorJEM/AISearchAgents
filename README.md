# AISearchAgents
Java program implementing the BFS, DFS, BestF, A* and  'Directional DFS' algorithms. 


.iml file is included so the project can be opened and run with intellij. Otherwise compile via running 'javac *.java' within the src direction, and run the program with
java A1main <DFS|BFS|BestF|AStar|DirectionalSearch> <Conf>. View the Conf and Map classes to view the different configurations, or run the test 'AlgoTest' to run every algorithm
over each problem configuration.
